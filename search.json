As two currently aspiring DJs, we wanted to understand the technical workings of audio modifications and create a low-cost, functional deck so that we could perform for our friends. Therfore, this project seeks to build an operational two-channel DJ Mixer that manipulates audio files based on user inputs. Our mixer will be able to control the frequency and gain of two input audio files based on physical inputs from the user. The FPGA will apply Finite Impule Response (FIR) digital filtering to the audio, based on user choosen EQ values passed in through the MCU. I2S protocols will be used to pass the audio into the FPGA and from the FPGA to the MCU. The onboard MCU DAC with Direct Memory Access (DMA) will output the manipulated audio to speakers."

For their E155 (AKA MicroPs) Final Project, they are working together to create a two-channel DJ mixer. Ultimately, they hope to DJ together with their mixer.\n\nVictoria Parizot - Norwalk, CT\nVictoria Parizot is most interested with mechanical and electrical design, and excited to be taking MicroPs this semester! At Harvey Mudd, she is a West Dorm President, a Machine Shop Proctor, and a Member of Tau Beta Pi Honors Society. In her free time, she enjoys woodworking, taking and developing film photos, and sailing.\nTake a look at her Portfolio to learn more!\n\n\nAudrey Vo - Valley Girl, CA\nAudrey is an APISPAM Head Sponsor, Atwood Dorm President, and Machine Shop Proctor at Harvey Mudd. The past few summers, she has been able to participate in summer research with Prof. Dodds in “Summer Start-Up” and with Prof. Gokli as part of the Riggs Fellowship. She was previously HMC 2025 Class President and also a member of the Prisoner Education Project.\nAudrey is currently a resident of Southern California, and have lived here her entire life. (If you have any recommendations of things to do in CA, please let Audrey know!). In her free time, she love to play pickleball, try new foods, and spend time with friends.\nIf you are interested in learning more about Audrey, please feel free to connect on LinkedIn or explore her portfolio!"

    "text": "Digital Filtering\nWe have set up the onboard MCU ADC to read in the four external potentiometer values and used SPI to transfer these EQ values to the FPGA to be used for digital filtering. We have opted for Finite Impulse Response (FIR) to apply low and high pass filters to the audio data that we will read in from the PCM1808 DAC. The EQ values correspond to 16 buckets between 0 to 20 kHz (the range of human hearing), with each bucket ranging 1.25 kHz (20 kHz/16). Thus, the EQ value influences the passband and stopband of the filters. To implement FIR, we have generated and tested the integer coefficients for the desired filters in Matlab and exported them as a .txt file. The filters will have 128 taps, a number derived from preliminary testing to find the minimum number of taps needed to create the desired filters. The .txt file of coefficients is read into the FPGA using an FSM and similar logic as sbox_sync in lab 7."

The MCU ADC converts these analog values into 8-bit values between 0 to 256, which will ultimately be used to determine the passband frequencies for the low and high pass filters.\nAfter the MCU interprets these voltages into 8-bit values, it passes these values using SPI to the FPGA. Below is an example of a working SPI interaction. When the potentiometer is set to approximately 79.\n\n\n\nEQ Values Printed Out Debug Terminal\n\n\n\n\n\nLogic Analyzer SPI"

The floating point and integer coefficients are shown below, where if we scale the signal we see that the shape of the plots are the same. Thus, when plotting the output signal, it is critical to scale the signal by dividing by g.\nThe below figures are for a lowpass filter with 128 taps and a pass band ending at 1250 hZ.\n\n\n\nInteger coefficients are scaled up from floating point coefficients\n\n\n\n\n\nFloating point and integer coefficients share the same shape\n\n\n\n\n\nFIR Filter as defined by coefficients\n\n\nWe then confirmed the design of these filters by creating a signal with multiple frequency components and applying our filter and gain scaling. To do this, we copied out verilog logic, allowing us to confirm that our logic acted as expected.\n\n\n\nOriginal signal with multiple frequency components\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput and original signal"

Thus, based on what the user selects, the code will then retrieve the set of 128 coefficients that correspond to the filter value that they requested. This was done by saving a .txt file with all 2048 coefficients (128 coefficients per filter, 16 different filter options), and then storing the desired coefficients synchronously in BRAM. An FSM is used to retrieve all 128 coefficients on each clock cycle that will then be used to digitally filter the signal."
