    "text": "Harvey Mudd College supplies a plethora of student DJs that perform regularly around the 5Cs. As two currently aspiring DJs, we wanted to understand the technical workings of audio modifications and create a low-cost, functional deck so that we could perform for our friends. Therfore, this project seeks to build an operational two-channel DJ Mixer that manipulates audio files based on user inputs. Our mixer will be able to control the frequency and gain of two input audio files based on physical inputs from the user. The FPGA will apply Finite Impule Response (FIR) digital filtering to the audio, based on user choosen EQ values passed in through the MCU. I2S protocols will be used to pass the audio into the FPGA and from the FPGA to the MCU. The onboard MCU DAC with Direct Memory Access (DMA) will output the manipulated audio to speakers."

    "text": "About Us\nAudrey and Victoria are seniors at Harvey Mudd College, majoring in engineering, and passionate about music. For their E155 (AKA MicroPs) Final Project, they are working together to create a two-channel DJ mixer. Ultimately, they hope to DJ together with their mixer.\n\nVictoria Parizot - Norwalk, CT\nVictoria Parizot is most interested with mechanical and electrical design, and excited to be taking MicroPs this semester! At Harvey Mudd, she is a West Dorm President, a Machine Shop Proctor, and a Member of Tau Beta Pi Honors Society. In her free time, she enjoys woodworking, taking and developing film photos, and sailing.\nTake a look at her Portfolio to learn more!\n\n\nAudrey Vo - Valley Girl, CA\nAudrey is an APISPAM Head Sponsor, Atwood Dorm President, and Machine Shop Proctor at Harvey Mudd. The past few summers, she has been able to participate in summer research with Prof. Dodds in “Summer Start-Up” and with Prof. Gokli as part of the Riggs Fellowship. She was previously HMC 2025 Class President and also a member of the Prisoner Education Project.\nAudrey is currently a resident of Southern California, and have lived here her entire life. (If you have any recommendations of things to do in CA, please let Audrey know!). In her free time, she love to play pickleball, try new foods, and spend time with friends.\nIf you are interested in learning more about Audrey, please feel free to connect on LinkedIn or explore her portfolio!"
