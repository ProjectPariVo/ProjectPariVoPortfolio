## Abstract
Harvey Mudd College supplies a plethora of student DJs that perform regularly around the 5Cs. As two currently aspiring DJs, we wanted to understand the technical workings of audio modifications and create a low-cost, functional deck so that we could perform for our friends. Therefore, this project seeks to build an operational two-channel DJ Mixer that manipulates audio files based on user inputs. Our mixer will be able to control the frequency and gain of audio input through an AUX cord based on physical inputs from the user.
The FPGA will apply Finite Impule Response (FIR) digital filtering to the audio, based on user choosen EQ values passed in through the MCU. The audio is then passed into the MCU, where the onboard MCU DAC with Direct Memory Access (DMA) will output the manipulated audio to speakers. 

A demo of our final project is here:

## About Us
Audrey and Victoria are seniors at [Harvey Mudd College](https://hmc.edu), majoring in engineering, and passionate about music. For their E155 (AKA MicroPs) Final Project, they are working together to create a two-channel DJ mixer. Ultimately, they hope to DJ together with their mixer.

### Victoria Parizot - Norwalk, CT
Victoria Parizot is most interested with mechanical and electrical design, and excited to be taking MicroPs this semester! At Harvey Mudd, she is a West Dorm President, a Machine Shop Proctor, and a Member of the Tau Beta Pi Honors Society. In her free time, she enjoys woodworking, taking and developing film photos, and sailing. 

Take a look at her [portfolio](https://vparizot.github.io/hmc-e155-portfolio/) to learn more!

### Audrey Vo - Valley Girl, CA
Audrey is an APISPAM Head Sponsor, Atwood Dorm President, and Machine Shop Proctor at Harvey Mudd. The past few summers, she has been able to participate in summer research with Prof. Dodds in “Summer Start-Up” and with Prof. Gokli as part of the Riggs Fellowship. She was previously HMC 2025 Class President and also a member of the Prisoner Education Project.

Audrey is currently a resident of Southern California, and have lived here her entire life. (If you have any recommendations of things to do in CA, please let her know!). In her free time, she love to play pickleball, try new foods, and spend time with friends.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank Professor Brake for his help and guidance throughout the project, especially with his help debugging. We would also like to thank the the E155 Grutors, especially Kavi, for going above and beyond with helping us think about and implement our project and labs. Finally, we would like to thank our classmates, who were always willing to lend a second perspective, even during late nights in the lab.
