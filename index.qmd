## Abstract
Harvey Mudd College supplies a plethora of student DJs that perform regularly around the 5Cs. As two currently aspiring DJs, we wanted to understand the technical workings of audio modifications and create a low-cost, functional deck so that we could perform for our friends. Therfore, this project seeks to build an operational two-channel DJ Mixer that manipulates audio files based on user inputs. Our mixer will be able to control the frequency and gain of two input audio files based on physical inputs from the user.
The FPGA will apply Finite Impule Response (FIR) digital filtering to the audio, based on user choosen EQ values passed in through the MCU. I2S protocols will be used to pass the audio into the FPGA and from the FPGA to the MCU. The onboard MCU DAC with Direct Memory Access (DMA) will output the manipulated audio to speakers. 

## About Us
Audrey and Victoria are seniors at [Harvey Mudd College](https://hmc.edu), majoring in engineering, and passionate about music. For their E155 (AKA MicroPs) Final Project, they are working together to create a two-channel DJ mixer. Ultimately, they hope to DJ together with their mixer.
